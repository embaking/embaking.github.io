<h2 id="Are-you-licensed"><a href="#Are-you-licensed" class="headerlink" title="Are you licensed?"></a>Are you licensed?</h2><p>In short, no, we are not. We currently operate under the Oregon Home Baking Bill (SB320) out of our home kitchen which is not licensed nor inspected.  My husband and I both hold valid food handlers cards and make sure that we follow safe food handling practices at all times.  We are hoping to one day expand into a commercial space as the business grows, however right now it just doesn’t pencil out.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-the-Oregon-Home-Baking-Bill"><a href="#What-is-the-Oregon-Home-Baking-Bill" class="headerlink" title="What is the Oregon Home Baking Bill?"></a>What is the Oregon Home Baking Bill?</h2><p>More correctly known as SB320, the Oregon Home Baking Bill allows small bakery businesses to operate without licensing or inspections if they abide by a number of restrictions.  When you order a cake or cupcakes from us, we will ask you a few questions to make sure that making your order won’t put us at risk of violating any regulations.</p>
<p>We are restricted from selling any foods that would be considered potentially hazardous.  This essentially means that if it requires refrigeration, we cannot sell it.  While we recommend refrigerating our cakes to keep the frosting firm it is not required for food safety.</p>
<p>We cannot sell to any commercial entity or institution.  This includes, but is not limited to: restaurants, grocery stores, caterers, schools, day care centers, hospitals, nursing homes or correctional facilities.</p>
<p>We must accept payment from you in person.  This means cash or checks only, please.  You can make checks payable to The Butter Nut Bakery LLC.</p>
<h2 id="Do-you-do-weddings-and-or-tastings"><a href="#Do-you-do-weddings-and-or-tastings" class="headerlink" title="Do you do weddings and/or tastings?"></a>Do you do weddings and/or tastings?</h2><p>Yes, we do both! We don’t mark our cakes up for weddings, because, well, that’s just plain smarmy. We do however, have some minor considerations that apply to all orders that you should be aware of.</p>
<p>We charge a small fee for tastings - just enough to cover ingredients and our time. Not to worry though, this fee will be credited to your order if you choose to place one with us.</p>
<p>We also require a refundable deposit when you place your final order if the total is over $200.  If you cancel your order at least two weeks before the delivery date, we will refund your entire deposit (less the tasting fee).  We do this to try to help offset the cost of the ingredients we’ve purchased to fulfill your order.</p>
<h2 id="Where-is-your-shop"><a href="#Where-is-your-shop" class="headerlink" title="Where is your shop?"></a>Where is your shop?</h2><p>We ask ourselves this question every day!  But honestly, we would love to have a shop one day, but as we are just a very small operation, we don’t have anywhere near the cash flow required to obtain our own dedicated storefront.  As mentioned above, we do all of our baking/packaging/ordering out of our home kitchen.</p>
<h2 id="Do-you-deliver"><a href="#Do-you-deliver" class="headerlink" title="Do you deliver?"></a>Do you deliver?</h2><p>Yes, we do!  Note that we charge for deliveries outside of the immediate Albany area.  We define “immediate Albany area” to be anywhere that is less than 15 miles from the Albany Courthouse (travel distance), as determined by Google maps.  Deliveries over 15 miles will incur a $1/mile delivery charge for every mile over 15 miles.  To calculate your delivery charge, we use this link and enter the delivery address.  We then take shortest route and round it down to the nearest 5 mile increment.  Finally, we subtract 15 from this number to find the final delivery charge.</p>
